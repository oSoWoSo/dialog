!!Work in Progress!!

void linux post install script using bash and dialog

Two versions

- dialog-iffi - a lot of if and fi

- dialog-case - use case instead of if and fi

Scripts are under heavy development!

For learning purpose!

Created for 64bit and glibc only (can change later)

A lot option works, but it's not for daily use yet!

Any advice, enhancement, help, participation, bug fixing in project are more then welcome...
